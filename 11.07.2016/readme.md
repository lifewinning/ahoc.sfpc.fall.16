# Architectural History of Computing Lecture 2 - 11/7/16

## Assignments for this Class

### Video 

I've made a [short YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaIFIu6lL8lIT6zYMYBo_HN7gOiobUl6b) of corporate videos about data centers. Watch them and consider the following: 

- What does the company think is the most important thing for people to know about its data center?
- What are some recurring themes or visuals that appear in all of the videos?
- What do you think the soundtrack is trying to ?

### Reading 

These are some of the things I'll be citing and referring to in class. **Try to read one of them**. During this class we'll talking about two concepts--how data centers shape space and how data centers shape time. The readings are listed below based on those concepts, then in order of shortest to longest.

#### Data Center Space

- "[Enough of the Cloud Already, What's Next for Enterprise Technology?](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richie-etwaru/enough-of-the-cloud-alrea_b_5056275.html)", Richie Etwaru

- "[The Environmental Toll of a Netflix Binge](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/12/there-are-no-clean-clouds/420744/)", Ingrid Burrington

- "Clicking Clean" report, Greenpeace (PDF in repo, more online [here](http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/click-clean/#report))

- excerpt from "Where The Internet Lives", Jennifer Holt and Patrick Vonderau (PDF in repo--you can stop reading at "Mapping the Cloud")

#### Data Center Time

- "[Inside Google Spanner, The Largest Single Database on Earth](https://www.wired.com/2012/11/google-spanner-time/) ", Cade Metz

- "[The Failed Attempt to Destroy GPS](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/03/the-failed-attempt-to-destroy-early-gps/386656/)", Ingrid Burrington 

- "Synchronizing Uncertainty: Google's Spanner and Cartographic Time", Brian House (PDF in repo)

- excerpt from "A Prehistory of the Cloud", Tung-Hui Hu (PDF in repo)

- "Cloud History, Cloud Memory", James Bridle (PDF in repo, also online [here](http://cloudindx.com/history/), the project that this essay is part of is also worth a look)
