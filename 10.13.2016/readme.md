# Architectural History of Computing Lecture .5 - 10/13/16

## Assignments for this Day

None! This is the introduction to the class as a whole. WELCOME. 

## Lecture Notes

- This class mostly is a consequence of this building that SFPC lives in--I have been interested in these topics for a while but when the school moved here it kind of seemed too perfect to not build a class around these subjects. 

- [Video of Claude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPKkXibQXGA): applications and the complexity of the machine

- **The mouse is not the territory**: there is an understandable impulse to locate the locus of technology in the object that serves as interface, but the actual computer is the context in which the interface operates. Theseus' computation is contingent. It's the difference between thinking about the power of my smartphone being inside the phone and the power of my smartphone being in the various apparatuses that my phone wirelessly connects to. 

- Bell Labs officially formed and took over this building in 1925, but construction on the building itself began in 1896. It was originally a Western Electric manufacturing facility. 

- Bell was officially in the building until 1966, although the first buildings in New Jersey were mostly constructed during World War II and employees mostly moved over there after that. 

- This is the landscape that is more typically associated with the architectural history of computing. The campus, the landscape of the knowledge worker. 

- Part of what we're going to read and talk about is reframing computer history as, essentially, industrial, environmental, and architectural history. 

- But I want to go back to Theseus' maze for a second with a totally different reference point. 

- [The *Tron: Legacy* opening sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTHCGcFH6jk)

- Show of hands how many people saw this movie? 

- I am showing you this partly because I love this movie (and its soundtrack), but also because I'm trying to more wholeheartedly embrace science fiction as a part of talking about the ways in which people relate to or think about technology. It encapsulates some of the weird paradoxes of living with computers and the difficulty of really comprehending and conveying what *living with computers* actually means. 

- The way that Flynn talks about getting into the Grid has this borderline spiritual tone that I find really interesting. Like he's entering into this higher dimension and he quite literally gets to play God in building this world inside the mainframe. Finding communion with the programs. Struggling with its inner daemons. 

- One of the appeals of computing (or, depending on how you look at it, creativity) is escape. Building something that is beyond oneself, that's bigger than oneself, through something ineffable and immaterial. But it's always sort of material. There's always an interface, an object, a network made of objects. There's always a cost. There's always the law of conservation of energy. 

- So if the *Tron* movies are about getting inside a computer and finding out it's a city, part of this class is about going into the city and finding out how it's a computer. 

## ENIAC/Personal Computers

- "The ENIAC itself, strangely, was a very personal computer. Now we think of a personal computer as one which you carry around with you. The ENIAC was actually one that you kind of lived inside." -- Harry Reed, mathematician who worked on the ENIAC (one of the earliest modern computers created in the United States)

- The devices get smaller, the room gets bigger. 

- What is required to maintain a planet-sized computer?

- What are the environmental costs of a planet-sized computer? Can it last? 

## In-Class Student Activity

- Think about and take 5 minutes to write down how you got here today and how many computers or networked objects you interacted with or passed in that process. This isn't really a thing where there's a wrong answer, it's more about seeing how many devices we interact with or think we interact with when we go through our day-to-day lives. 

- Talk through the different technologies used in that process, where they are as a way to walk through taxonomy??? Maybe this will work IDK

- Things That Might Not Make Their List
	- Metrocard kiosks
	- Street traffic furniture
	- GPS
	- Data centers
	- Internet exchanges
	- Surveillance cameras

## Computer Landscapes Taxonomy

- So there's a few ways we can organize a taxonomy of machines. For this discussion we're going to organize them spatially. 

	- Space (Satellites)
	- Atmosphere (Wireless)
	- Terrestrial (Data Centers, Street Furniture, Personal Devices)
	- Subterranean (Cables)
	- Submarine (Cables)

- But what if we go deeper than that? Where does this stuff come from? Where does it go when it dies?

	- Mines
	- Manufacturing
	- Logistics
	- Corporate
	- End-of-Life (Recycling/Landfill/Etc)

- The point is when you start to unpack all of the *stuff* required to make a networked world possible, that fantasy of immateriality of code starts to disappear real fast. 

## OK But This Class Is Only 4 Weeks

- Yes I know and I have just overwhelmed you with a lot of things

- We're only going to have space for some of this material, and that is a bummer for sure

- There will be lots of bonus material in the repo

- We can't cover every aspect of every weird thing but the main goal of the class is to get you thinking about the following:

	- Technology is politically and historically situated
	- Technology is material and has consequences
	- Technology is contingent and could be otherwise
