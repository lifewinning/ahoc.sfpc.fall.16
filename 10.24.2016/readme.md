***

## Walk Notes

### Objective of the walk:

- Learn about some of the companies and institutions that shaped computer history, in particular AT&T and the U.S. Military
- Learn about the procedures and systems behind infrastructure installation in New York City
- Understand the influence of *urgency* and *scale* on development of technology, be able to critically interrogate those influences
- Recognize elements of network infrastructure in public space

### Sites Visited

#### 270 Broadway

- Date Built: 1930
- Architect: E.H. Faile & Company

- Today this part of the building is residential. We’re starting here for two reasons: one, it made more sense to start from the southernmost point on the route, and two, because in 1942 in apartment 18D General Leslie Groves initiated what at first was referred to as the “Laboratory for the Development of Substitute Materials” but, fearing it might be too obvious a cover, was renamed for this location within the North Atlantic Army Corps of Engineers office. 
- The Manhattan Engineering District oversaw only one project that, within a year, had its central offices relocated to Washington, DC and Oak Ridge, TN, but the name “Manhattan Project” stuck. 
- There isn’t a particular moment of computational history that happened here, but for reasons that will probably make more sense as we go along today it seemed like we would be remiss not to include it.

#### 33 Thomas 

- Date Built: 1974
- Architect: John Carl Warnecke

- Built for AT&T’s Long Lines Division as a switching station
- 29 floors, 18-foot tall floors, can hold 200-300 pounds per square foot
- Warnecke in particular
	- also designed John F. Kennedy’s gravesite at Arlington National Cemetery?
	- Known for an architectural concept called “contextualism”—which is essentially what it sounds like, designing buildings with attention to and respect for their surroundings.
- In the case of 33 Thomas, if you don’t factor in the total absence of windows I guess you could say that it blends in. 
- It’s admittedly kind of a terrifying building but it’s one in which form pretty explicitly follows function. The lack of windows is kind of a part of this. Aside from the fact that by 1974 telephone switching equipment didn't require switchboard operators or, really, very many humans. The design of the building is more optimized for machines than for humans, hence, no windows. 
- The lack of windows is also a form of reinforcements: the building was designed to resist nuclear blast and fallout and be self-sufficient for two weeks in wartime conditions. 
- 1991 Incident:
	- Because the building was designed to be self-sufficient, AT&T had a load shedding agreement with the electric utility, Consolidated Edison, where they would voluntarily switch from utility power to on-site generators on request. This was a routine procedure that had been performed successfully in the past.
	- After switching power sources, standard procedure was to check all the equipment power supplies, known as DC plants, for problems. But the people who usually did those visual checks were training technicians at a different AT&T site at 811 Tenth Avenue that day. The alarms were not detected until it was too late to maintain uninterrupted power. This led to the central switch in the building being completely disabled.
	- Over 5 million calls were blocked, and Federal Aviation Administration private lines were also interrupted, disrupting air traffic control to 398 airports serving most of the northeastern United States. 
	- Basically, a fun reminder that things built and designed not exactly for humans still kind of need the humans.

#### 60 Hudson

- Date Built: 1930
- Architect: Ralph Walker of Voorhees, Gmelin, and Walker

- New York’s internet history is deeply intertwined with the history of the telegraph and the telephone, and the two buildings that best represent that history are 60 Hudson and 32 Avenue of the Americas, which are both just below Canal street in downtown Manhattan. 

- The stories behind both of these buildings in some ways begins over at 195 Broadway, the original New York headquarters of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and Western Union (a space used for offices by AT&T until 1978). 
- In 1914, switching equipment for both companies was moved to 24 Walker Street, but eventually Western Union outgrew this space and in 1928 commissioned the architecture firm Voorhees, Gmelin, and Walker to design what would become 60 Hudson. 
- In turn, AT&T hired the same firm to create a new building on the footprint of the same block as the Walker Street building, completing 32 Avenue of the Americas in 1932. 
- Since so much of AT&T’s and Western Union’s operations overlapped with each other, the creation of the two separate buildings, less than ten blocks apart, also meant the creation of a dense underground cable duct infrastructure. Beneath Church Street, rows and rows of conduit filled with copper wires connect 60 Hudson to 32 Avenue of the Americas.
- This connection made 60 Hudson a major telephone exchange site during the deregulation of the U.S. telephone industry in the 1970s, when nascent competitor telephone companies like MCI and Sprint rapidly moved their equipment into into 60 Hudson in order to take advantage of the duct infrastructure that made it extremely easy to connect their networks to AT&T’s network. 
- 60 Hudson’s evolution into carrier hotel followed naturally from this period--today, It is home to hundreds of internet companies’ equipment and has the largest concentration of connections to transatlantic cables on the East Coast.

#### 32 Avenue of the Americas

- Built: 1932
- Architect: Ralph Walker of Voorhees, Gmelin, and Walker

- 32 Avenue of the America’s conversion to carrier hotel began with its acquisition by real estate company Rudin Management in 1999. 
- Not only are they hubs of communication, but both buildings are also magnificent examples of the Deco period in which they were created, and their lobbies harken back to a time when telecommunications had an air of grandeur and idealism (the mosaics on the walls of the 32 Avenue of the Americas building are an absolute must-see for this). 


## Class Dicussion/Lecture

- Discussion of the Walk/What We Saw

- Ursula Franklin
	- Background on Franklin
		- 1921-2016
		- Metallurgist who worked in Canada
		- *Real World of Technology* was writtne in 1989
		- Born Munich, Germany; spent some of her life in a Nazi work camp during WWII
		- on science: 

		> "My main interest then developed into solid-state crystal structure and the concept of structure: The arrangement of the parts to make a whole, and how the properties of the whole are not just the sum of the parts, but profoundly affected by the respective positioning of the parts to form the whole. That was a sort of [interest] that has stayed with me and [transferred] very easily into the political and the social things. So it’s all the back and forth of life—it’s always been navigating around a standing structure and changing them so as to change their properties. And that applies, of course, as much to making special alloys of metal as it applies to any other social situation, so I have a sense of cause and consequence very much, being brought up, that things happen for a reason—that they have roots; that they are, in turn, the feedback for consequence, which are then the shoot; and much of that ‘root and shoot’ tighten my thinking."

- *Real World of Technology*
	- I often worry when I assign this text that it seems too obvious, but every time I go back to re-read it I'm mostly just totally refreshed and happy to be able to get that reality check that Franklin does so well.
	- What I love about these lectures is that she uses a broad definition of technology that I think is more appropriate for talking about our times than the assumptions of "tech" as "computers"--in the same way that [what we call "the tech industry"](https://medium.com/humane-tech/there-is-no-technology-industry-44774dfb3ed7) no longer actually means "computers!" or something. 
	- Franklin defines technology as "ways of doing something", as practice, as systems constructed by humans. So a computer is a "technology" but it's a product of the "technology" of mining technology, manufacturing technology, supply chain technology, and marketing and commerce technology. It's technology all the way down.  
	- Franklin discusses a dichotomy of *holistic* vs. *prescriptive* technologies, with holistic referring to a a technology that engages its user in the total production process (artisan craftsmanship, for example) and prescriptive referring to technologies whose complexity and scale require a kind of division of labor, managerial hierarchy, and in Franklin's view are "designs for compliance." 
	- She aslo says that "any tasks that require caring whether for people or nature, any tasks that require immediate feedback and adjustment, are best done holistically."
	- Is the holistic vs prescriptive a dichotomy or a continuum? Can a prescriptive technology be used holistically? Is any attempt to "scale" a holistic technology inevitably a way of making it prescriptive?
	- Is Franklin right about the superiority of the holistic in care-related tasks? 
	- Where would we put assistive technology in this continuum?
	- At one point Franklin also notes that "almost nothing is known about the global energy need of devices or about their lifespans"--would seeking this kind of knowledge be a *holsitic* approach to devices?
